<p><title>utGen only works with basic data types Chris Rimmer chrisrimmer chris@nominet.org.uk</title>
I tried running utGen on a package which contains a procedure which looks like:<br>
<br>
PROCEDURE MyProc (char_a IN VARCHAR2,<br>
                  char_b IN VARCHAR2,<br>
                  num_a IN NUMBER,<br>
                  cur_out OUT MY_CURSOR_TYPE);<br>
<br>
The ut_MyProc procedure which is generated contains a call to MyProc which contains the first three arguments, mixed together with an argument for every column which the cursor type contains.  A bit of a mess, especially as the table it references contains 60 columns!<br>
<br>
Taking at look at utGen, it looks like the query on ALL_ARGUMENTS should only be concerned with rows where the DATA_LEVEL column is zero.  I realise that handling records, cursors etc in full generality would be tough.<br>

PS I gave it a quick go under v2, but the package body only contained ut_setup and ut_teardown. (Is this a v2 bug?)<br>
