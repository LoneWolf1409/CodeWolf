<h1>
Welcome to utPLSQL</h1>

<h2>
a unit testing framework for the Oracle
PL/SQL Language</h2>

<h2>
<a href="started.html">Getting Started</a></h2>

<blockquote>This document tells you the minimum you need
to know in order to get started with utPLSQL: how to install the software,
build simple test packages, and run your tests.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="buildpack.html">Build Test Packages</a></h2>

<blockquote>utPLSQL provides with you a framework in which
to run your tests. You still have to write your test code, and that code
must follow some rules if utPLSQL is going to know how to run those tests.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="examples.html">Examples</a></h2>

<blockquote>There is no better way to learn how to build
and run utPLSQL test packages than to work from the many examples found
here.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="userguide.html">User Guide</a></h2>

<blockquote>Once you are familiar with utPLSQL basics, have
run some tests, and are ready to learn and use more of the many utPLSQL
features, the User Guide will tell you all you need to know about the different
features and programs of utPLSQL.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="release.html">Release Notes</a></h2>

<blockquote>Well, you know what these are: a description
of fixes and enhancements in the latest release!</blockquote>

<h2>
<a href="map.html">Document Map</a></h2>

<blockquote>The full list of the pages in the documentation</blockquote>
Lots of information about utPLSQL is also available on the
Internet at the the <a href="http://oracle.oreilly.com/utplsql">utPLSQL</a>
site of the O'Reilly and Associates Oracle Resource Center, including a
<a href="http://forums.oreilly.com/~utplsql/">Webboard</a>
that will allow you to ask questions, see what others have done with utPLSQL,
and post your own contributions.
