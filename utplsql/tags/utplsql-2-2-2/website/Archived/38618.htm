Yes, I've taken a look and the GPL is drawn up so that you can bundle it with any software without alteration.  You just need to refer to it in the source.<br>
<br>
The text of the GPL is at <a target=_new href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt</a> - it actually includes a description of how to apply it to your own software (see the section at the end).<br>
<br>
Basically, it allows the free modification and distribution of the software.  It also ensures that any such distribution continues to be under the terms of the GPL.<br>
