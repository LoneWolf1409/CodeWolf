<p><title>Boolean Function Versions of utAssert Procedures Chris Rimmer chrisrimmer chris@nominet.org.uk</title>
I agree that the tests should be independent of one another.  Does this mean that the assertions within a test must be independent of one another?<br>
<br>
The case I was thinking of was where I run a procedure which (in the case being tested) should create a number records in various tables.  This means I will need a large number of assertions to verify that it has succeeded.  So I start by doing some SELECT COUNT(*) queries on the tables (The Basic Tests), then actually check the contents of the tables (The Detailed Tests).<br>
<br>
In my example, I didn't mean that some tested function would be called in each assertion with different arguments. Perhaps I should have been clearer.<br>
