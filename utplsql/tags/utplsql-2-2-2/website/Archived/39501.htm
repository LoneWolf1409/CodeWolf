<p><title>Requirments Larry Church lchurch lchurch@corp.cma.com</title>
I have few basic requirements questions before I give utPLSQL a spin.<br>
<br>
1.  Oracle Database.  Can I create a database just for this utility?  As the QA Engineer I will install and modify the utility for use at our shop.  Each of our many developers will access the tool from their workstations to run their own unit tests.  Is there a need to connect to the production database where the real databases and tables live?  Or, can we create a copy of the tables, and leave them empty, on the test databse?  Or, does the utility work independently from the production database and not require metadata such as file columns and cardinality statistics?<br>
<br>
2.  How much space do I need to ask for on the Oracle database for this utility.  My guess is the answer is, it depends on the number of testcases.  Seems to me 50 meg should be more than enough, correct?<br>
<br>
Appreciate any input I can get.<br>
