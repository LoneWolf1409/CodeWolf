We do seem to be at cross-purposes!  <br>

I think you are saying that the testing engine should always use the 'current' configuration, regardless of the schema the tested code is in.  So code will always be tested with the user's own configuration unless they choose another one.  From which point, it will be tested with that configuration instead.<br>
<br>
Is that right?  That seems to make sense.  It means that the owner_in parameter in utPLSQL.test is only used to run the right code, not to set the configuration used.<br>
