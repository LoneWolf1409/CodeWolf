<p><title>A 'Coverage' Indication Chris Rimmer chrisrimmer chris.rimmer@tessella.co.uk</title>
When testing a package, it would be nice to know if the tests have covered all of the functions and procedures in that package.<br>
<br>
So suppose my package A contains procedures P1...P5 and functions F1...F5.  I write a test package ut_A with testing procedures ut_P1...ut_P5 and ut_F1...ut_F5.  Next, I add some extra procedures to A called (imaginatively) P6 and P7. If I write ut_P7, but forget to write ut_P6, it would be nice if I was warned about this when I next run my tests.  I would only expect this to work on the basis of the names of the procedures.<br>
