<p><title>Requirments Steven Feuerstein sfeuerstein steven@stevenfeuerstein.com</title>
You can install and use utPLSQL wherever you have installed and plan to run your code. You definitely do NOT have to connect to and run from your production database. <br>
<br>
You will need to have the code and underlying data structures installed for your application, though.<br>
<br>
As to space, utPLSQL itself requires very little space. If you are testing a large package with many modules and lots of test cases, your test packages might get large, but yes I would think that 50MB would be way more than enough room for quite a while.<br>
