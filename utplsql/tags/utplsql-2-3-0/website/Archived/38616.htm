No, I don't, but it seems pretty simple.  Judging by other software, you just grab a copy of the GNU GPL, distribute it with your code and put a few messages in the code etc. saying that it is distributed in accordance with the licence.  There are more details at www.gnu.org - I'll check it out.<br>
<br>
As far as all the different types of licences go, it does seem a bit confusing to try to pick through the differences.<br>
