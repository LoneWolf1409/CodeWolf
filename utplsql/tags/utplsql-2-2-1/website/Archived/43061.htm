<p><title>Ref cursors Steven Feuerstein sfeuerstein steven@stevenfeuerstein.com</title>
I think that if the ref cursor was declared as a weak type (no RETURN specified), it MIGHT be possible. Still, I have to be able to know the structure of the cursor that is associated with the ref cursor. I am not sure how I can get that. I suppose you could provide the query behind the cursor. In that case, it is pretty much the same as utAssert.eqcursor.<br>
