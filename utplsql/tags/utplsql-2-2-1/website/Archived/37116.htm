My responses...<br>
 <br>
**** latest code and docs at oreilly site (which I've downloaded), or at the sourceforge site?<br>
<br>
OReilly site.<br>
<br>
**** oreilly's webboard seems to have replaced the eGroups area around 8/15 (if this is true and it's not there, perhaps a "goodbye here's the fowarding address" message on eGroups would be good)<br>
<br>
I am maintaining the egroups list as a list of people who might want to get involved in the development effort. I think that is the way it is described at the utPLSQL site.<br>
<br>
**** utPLSQL to be promoted by oreilly and OTNx?<br>
<br>
It is promoted by OReilly today. We will probably set it up as a project at OTNx as that developers and the option becomes available.<br>
<br>
*** PLNet seems to be floundering, being replaced by OTNx?<br>
<br>
Not sure. Check with Bill Pribyl about this...<br>
<br>
*** Can you add me to sourceforge project?<br>
<br>
No need to.<br>
<br>
Thanks, SF
