Well I wrote one and have submitted it to Steven.  This means it should be in the next release, but since I think he is probably putting the finishing touches to his new book (due next month) you may have to wait a while.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, you can achieve the same effect by doing the following to check that the correct value of SQLCODE is obtained:<br>
<br>
<TT><br>
BEGIN<br>
<br>
  MyPackage.MyProcedure;<br>
<br>
  utAssert.this('No Exception', FALSE);<br>
<br>
EXCEPTION<br>
<br>
  WHEN OTHERS THEN<br>
<br>
    utAssert.eq('Exception', SQLCODE,<br>
      MyExpectedValue);<br>
<br>
END;<br>
</TT><br>
<br>
Alternatively, if you are using named exceptions you change the exception block to look for the correct exception instead...<br>
