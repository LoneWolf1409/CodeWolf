<p><title>Alpha version 2.0.5 available Steven Feuerstein sfeuerstein steven@stevenfeuerstein.com</title>
Dear utPLSQLers:<br>
<br>
I have uploaded to the utPLSQL discussion board the next alpha release (2.0.5) of utPLSQL. The main advance so far in V2 is that test results are now written to a database table, utr_outcome, instead of simply displayed to the screen (I have also fixed some problems just reported concerning utAssert.eq tests involving NULL values).<br>
<br>
I have not yet compiled release notes for it, but here is my rationalization for sending out this software without this reasonable minimum of documentation:<br>
<br>
I believe that at this point in my V2 development, I have achieved 100% backward compatibility with V1. In other words, you should be able to run all existing code and see your results show up in your SQL*Plus session and so on as before (in fact, you will see MORE information, as it now reports on successful and failed tests).<br>
<br>
NOTE: this release of utPLSQL v2 corrects a number of installation problems in the 2.0.2 release I sent last month.<br>
<br>
So I thought this would be a good time to send it out to all of you brave souls to install and test simply to let me know if you see any problems with accessing current functionality. That is all I am really looking for from you, but you are certainly encouraged to explore some of the new functionality and to that end I also attach a file named qu_test.sql which demonstrates the population of database tables which we can be used to access the new features.<br>
<br>
NOTE: the utplsql_install script does NOT un-install the product first. To do so, run utplsql_uninstall.sql first.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your support. Please report any problems to the utPLSQL Webboard discussion forum under the new "V2 Issues" (this conference, in fact).<br>
<br>
Many thanks, SF
