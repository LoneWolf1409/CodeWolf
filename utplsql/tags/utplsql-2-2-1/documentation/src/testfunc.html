   <h1>Test a Function</h1>

   <p>
      As with the procedure, there are a couple of scenarios to consider:
   </p>

   <ul>
      <li>
         The <a href="#ScalarFunction">function returns a scalar value</a> (number,
         date, string, Boolean). In this case, you can embed your call to the function
         directly inside a call to a uAssert assertion program, making your test
         procedure very concise and easy to write.
      </li>
      <li>
         The function returns a non-scalar value,
         such as an object or a collection. In this case, you will need to call
         the function and then evaluate the contents of the returned structure.
      </li>
      <li>
         A third situation to consider is that your function returns a value, but
         it also takes a number of other actions, the success of which is not reflected
         in the returned value. Fully testing such a function (one with "side effects")
         can be very difficult, since you must test for a variety of conditions.
      </li>
   </ul>

   <h3><a name="ScalarFunction"></a>Testing a Scalar Function</h3>
   
   <p>
      First, a test of a function returning a scalar value. Consider the following
      packaged function:
   </p>

<pre>
/*file str.pks and str.pkb */
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE str
IS
   FUNCTION betwn (
      string_in IN VARCHAR2,
      start_in IN PLS_INTEGER,
      end_in IN PLS_INTEGER
   )
      RETURN VARCHAR2;
END str;
/
</pre>

   <p>
      The str.betwn function returns the sub-string of a string_in that is found
      between the start and end locations specified by start_in and end_in.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      So...time to test! I <a href="utgen.html">generate a test package</a>
      and then modify the unit test procedure to check for various conditions:
   </p>
   
<pre>
/*file ut_str.pkb */
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY ut_str
IS
   PROCEDURE ut_setup
   IS
   BEGIN
      NULL;
   END;
   
   PROCEDURE ut_teardown
   IS
   BEGIN
      NULL;
   END;

   -- For each program to test...
   PROCEDURE ut_betwn IS
   BEGIN
      utAssert.eq (
         'Typical Valid Usage',
         str.betwn ('this is a string', 3, 7),
         'is is' 
         );
         
      utAssert.eq (
         'Test Negative Start',
         str.betwn ('this is a string', -3, 7),
         'ing'
         );
         
      utAssert.isNULL (
         'Start bigger than end',
         str.betwn ('this is a string', 3, 1)
         );
   END ut_betwn;

END ut_str;
/
</pre>

   <p>
      As you can see, my calls to str.betwn are embedded right within calls to
      utAssert.eq and utAssert.isNULL, making my test code compact.
   </p>
