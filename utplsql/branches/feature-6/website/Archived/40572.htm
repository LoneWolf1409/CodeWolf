First of all, thanks for this great project! I'm just starting to evaluate it, but one of my concerns about the new XP process we want to use, was the testing of PL/SQL code...<br>
Until now!<br>
<br>
Just my 2c for the installations notes:<br>
you should include the two steps<br>
<br>
grant execute on sys.dbms_pipe to utplsql<br>
<br>
grant create public synonym to utplsql<br>
<br>
in the documentation.<br>
As I saw in other posts, I was not the only one who noticed that.<br>
<br>
I'll go back to testing the tests...<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Olaf<br>
