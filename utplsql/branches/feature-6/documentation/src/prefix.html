<h1>
Use Non-Default Prefix</h1>

<p>The default prefix for utPLSQL is "ut_", but you don't have to use that
prefix. There are some situations where you absolutely will not want to
use the default prefix. Suppose, for example, that you have written a package
with ten procedures, each of which <i>already</i> have "ut_" as a prefix
(it might stand for "Unified Technologies" or "Underside Treatment: or...well,
you get the picture).
<p>Since this prefix is not hard-coded into utPLSQL, you can very easily
specify your own prefix. You can do this when you run a test, as in:
<pre>SQL&gt; utPLSQL.test ('te_employee', prefix_in =&gt; 'test_');</pre>
You can also specify a prefix when you add a package to a test suite, as
in:
<pre>SQL&gt; utPackage.add ('mysuite', 'mypackage' prefix_in =&gt; 'test_');</pre>
Of course, when you specify a non-default prefix, you must also build your
test package using that prefix. If you plan to generate a starting point
for your package with utGen, be sure to specify your prefix at that point,
as in:
<pre>SQL&gt; utGen.testpkg('mypackage' prefix_in =&gt; 'test_');</pre>
For an example of a package with a non-default prefix, check out test_te_employee.pks
and test_te_employee.pkb (Both to be found in the Examples directory of the utPLSQL distribution).
