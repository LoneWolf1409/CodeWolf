Alright. I've signed up at egroups (turns out I signed up eons ago for some other group, but forgot membership and password!). I read the 51 messages. At this point, I'd like to read the docs and use the beta with the latest release of our billing system I'm working on. I'm sure enhancement requests and enhancement attempts will come out of that.<br>
 <br>
This is my best guess as to where things are at:<br>
 <br>
    - latest code and docs at oreilly site (which I've downloaded), or at the sourceforge site?<br>
    - oreilly's webboard seems to have replaced the eGroups area around 8/15 (if this is true and it's not there, perhaps a "goodbye here's the fowarding address" message on eGroups would be good)<br>
    - utPLSQL to be promoted by oreilly and OTNx?<br>
    - PLNet seems to be floundering, being replaced by OTNx?<br>
    - Can you add me to sourceforge project?<br>
