<p><title>Licencing of utPLSQL Chris Rimmer chrisrimmer chris.rimmer@tessella.co.uk</title>
Since utPLSQL is an Open Source project, I was wondering what the licensing situation was going to be.  I notice that the Readme currently says "Copyright 2000 Steven Feuerstein", but nothing else seems to be mentioned on this point.  Is it intended to be freely available forever (e.g. GNU GPL)?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to suggest that Steven is going to sucker us all into helping him develop utPLSQL and then make a proprietary product out of it.  The point is, what's stopping someone else incorporating it into their product without our consent?<br>
<br>
Perhaps I'm paranoid, or I've been reading Slashdot too much...<br>
<br>
