Hi Steven and all -<br>
<br>
I've been eyeing utplsql for a month now like I would a new Ferrari.  I finally had some time to download it today and after bribing my dba with a trip to Aruba in exchange for utl_file access and create synonym rights, I think I have everything set up correctly.<br>
<br>
It appears that utplsql is doing what it is supposed to, but the odd thing is that when I attempt the betwnstr example, it fails "null end" test.  Indeed, when I run<br>
<br>
select betwnstr('abcde', 2, null) from dual<br>
<br>
I get 'bcde' as the answer.  But when I run<br>
<br>
select substr('abcde', 2, null - 2 + 1) from dual<br>
<br>
I get null.  Can anyone explain this?  We're on Oracle 7.3.4 with PL/SQL 3.3.4.0.0.  Many thanks.<br>
