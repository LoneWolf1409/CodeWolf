<p><title>Results Tables Kevin Barnes malhamcove kevin.barnes@phocis.com</title>
we were having problems getting the result (success/failure) into a Java program that we use to do continuous integration testing.  However we found the UT_PACKAGE table which has the result of the last run of the test.  I tried using the ut_result stuff but couldn't get to see what was in the array.  What we wanted was to be able to pass the failure message (where it tells you what has failed back to Java) .Anyway we can use the  UT_PACKAGE table.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
