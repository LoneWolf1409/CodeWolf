Padders -<br>

You raise lots of good ideas, particularly around ways to define and run tests without having to write so much code. <br>
<br>
Some responses:<br>
<br>
- I don't see why you would turn tests on and off. The whole point (as I understand it) is to build a large body of unit tests, ALL of which must work ALL the time. <br>
<br>
- The performance of unit tests are not relevant. Performance of the app is, but that is a separate issue.<br>
<br>
- In terms of reporting on the test results, the approach is red light-green light. Either it works (green light, nothing else to report) or fails (red light, in which the testing mechanism does already report on sources of failure.<br>
<br>
- But actually, I think you are wanting to document what the unit tests COVER, right? So you can report that you have handled a wide variety of cases. utPLSQL could and should certainly be enhanced to support that. I would caution against trying too much automation. The bottom line is that in most cases, we will have to WRITE THE TEST CODE and not have it generated. It gets too specific. So at a minimum, I would see a way to document the test or test case and some how associate it with the code. <br>
<br>
Stepping back a bit, I hope that you or others would get interested enough to actually participate in the development process. I can't and don't want to be doing all this myself!<br>
<br>
Oh, and, this conversation should really be happening at:<br>
<br>
<a target=_new href="http://forums.oreilly.com/~utplsql/">http://forums.oreilly.com/~utplsql/</a><br>
<br>
which OReilly set up specifically for discussions around utPLSQL and testing. Would you please<br>
post your message there under enhancements? I will then post this answer there as well.<br>
<br>
Thanks,SF
