<p><title>Avoid use of synonyms on install! Steven Feuerstein sfeuerstein steven@stevenfeuerstein.com</title>
First off I will say I am biased on the following topic. I hate public synonyms! I consider them to be a lazy way to give people<br>
access to database objects. I much prefer grants and private synonyms. Here is how I think they should be handled in utlplsql.<br>
<br>
1) the main utlplsql user creates all of its required objects with zero grants and zero synonyms of any type<br>
<br>
2) another user desires access to what utlplsql has to offer so he subscribes by creating private synonyms in his account for the objects in the utlplsql account<br>
<br>
3) the utlplsql user then deems the other user worthy of access and grants them the necessary privileges<br>
<br>
We would have to code the subscribe and grant procedures but I think it makes things much more professional overall.<br>
<br>
OK, I have now stepped down from my soapbox. Does anyone agree with me?<br>
