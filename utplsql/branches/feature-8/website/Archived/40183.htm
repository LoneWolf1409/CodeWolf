That's a nice idea and a relatively easy enhancement given the current weak enhancement. <br>
<br>
I have, on the other hand, already started working with a person on the utPLSQL eGroups list to come up with a design for "result tables": a set of tables that store persistently the results information for each run, allowing a much more flexible analysis and history. <br>
<br>
I don't think he is too far along, but that is my preference for enhancements in this area.<br>
