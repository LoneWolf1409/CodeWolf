<p><title>Setup and Teardown procedures Steven Deneir sdeneir stevendeneir@writeme.com</title>
utPLSQL is a great initiative !<br>
Still some questions / remarks<br>
<ul><br>
<li><br>
Apparently the setup and teardown procedures are launched only at the beginning and at the end of the unit-test.<br>
This involves some problems : if the unit to test reads and manipulates data, the tester must take these changes into consideration for the following test, which isn't that easy.<br>
Some people will argue to use the Rollback statement. But what with functions that issue a commit statement and that are used in the unit that must be tested ?<br>
It would be nice to have the possibility to specify for each test whether or not the setup/teardown should be re-executed. In that way there is no performance loss when no data-manipulation takes place.<br>
</li><br>
<li><br>
Most of the time there are more procedures/functions to test within a package. But I only see 1 setup/teardown procedure. Does that mean that for all the routines to test in the package there is only 1 setup/teardown procedure ?<br>
If this is the case, the tester must make sure that all necessary data is available for all procedures that will be tested...<br>
Maybe there should be a setup/teardown for each procedure/function within a package.<br>
</li><br>
<li><br>
In the doc 'Build Test Packages.htm' there is a line indicating :<br>
exec utgen.testpkg ('str', output_type_in => utplsql.c_file)<br>
But utplsql.c_file does not exists, I think this should be : <br>
exec utgen.testpkg ('str', output_type_in => utgen.c_file);<br>
</li><br>
<li><br>
Is it possible not to use scripts (OS-files) where the source is stored ? I am always working with one or another tool, so I rarely use scripts.<br>
This goes for the recompilation of the packages and for the generation of the framework.<br>
</li><br>
</ul><br>
Regards,<br>
