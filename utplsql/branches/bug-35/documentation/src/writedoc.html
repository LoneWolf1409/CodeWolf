   <title>How to add to the utPLSQL documentation set</title>
</head>
<body>

   <h2>Writing Documentation</h2>

   <p>
      The utPLSQL documentation is built from a series of simple HTML files in the
      src directory.  These files have none of the navigation bars, logos or
      next/previous links which appear in the final documentation.  They are also
      stripped of font, color and style information at compile-time to let the
      stylesheet (utplsql.css) determine the overall look-and-feel.
   </p>

   <p> 
      Like the code, the documentation is held within 
      SVN. So to make changes, you should checkout the latest version from the 
      trunk, make your changes, then submit an SVN "diff" file to a 
      <a href = "https://sourceforge.net/p/utplsql/_list/tickets">ticket</a>
   </p>

   <h3>The HTML Files</h3>

   <p>
      As described above, the base files in the src directory are used to generate the final 
      product.  To add new documentation to one of these files, or to correct errors,
      simply edit it.  It makes sense to follow the layout that is already present in the 
      file, adding links at the top of the page where appropriate.  The HTML should be
      kept simple, so use the relevant header styles (&lt;H1&gt;...&lt;H6&gt;) to label your sections
      and subsections, use &lt;pre&gt; to mark sections of code etc.  Let the stylesheet
      do the work of setting the colors and fonts.
   </p>

   <p>
      If you are adding an entirely new file to the documentation, use the file 
      <code>template.html</code> as a basis.  This contains the relevant comment 
      lines which tell the scripts which parts of the file to use 
      (see the <a href="#comment">note below</a>). Finally, you will need to 
      edit map.txt to ensure that the file is linked from the other pages in 
      the documentation.  This is described in the next section.
   </p>

   <h3>The Control Files</h3>

   <p>
      The files are compiled into a documentation set situated in the top-level
      documentation directory using the 3 control files: map.txt, authors.txt and copyright_years.txt.
      The first of these is the driving file, giving a list of the files to be
      included.  The second gives a list of authors to be included in the copyright
      notice on each page and referenced in the Meta tags (this is for 
      historical reasons and lists the original contributors of the 
      documentation - to keep it in line with the policy for source-code, all 
      future contributions will go under the name of "the utPLSQL Project"). The
      third file lists the years for the copyright statement - i.e. years when
      significant changes were published.
   </p>

   <p>The format of map.txt is as follows:</p>

<pre>
   # Any line starting with a # is 
   # considered a comment
   #
   index.html,Home*
   started.html,Getting Started*
   another.html,Further Docs
   another2.html,Yet more docs
</pre>

   <p>
      Each line consists of the filename to be included and the title of the page,
      separated with a comma. Any file whose title is followed by an asterisk is
      considered the start of a new section.  This means a link to the file will
      appear in the navigation bar at the top of each page and it will appear in
      bold in the document map.  Note that the document map itself does not appear
      in map.txt, but is always added at the end and is considered a new section.
      This page is entirely generated at compile-time.
   </p>

   <p>
      To add a new page to the documentation, simply add it to this file in the 
      correct position.  Note that generally you will not be adding a new section!
   </p> 

   <p>The format of authors.txt is as follows:</p>

<pre>
   # Again, lines starting # are ignored
   #
   Steven Feuerstein,steven@stevenfeuerstein.com
   Chris Rimmer,c@24.org.uk
   A N Other,ano@ther.net
</pre>

   <p>
      Each line in this file simply gives the name of the author and their email
      address, separated with a comma. So if you've made a contribution and your name
      is not listed, add it!
   </p> 
   
   <p>The format of copyright_years.txt is as follows:</p>

<pre>
   # Again, lines starting # are ignored
   #
   2000-2005
   2014
</pre>

   <p>
      Each line will be separated by a comma in the copyright statement, so the 
      above will generate: "2000-2005, 2014"
   </p> 

   <h3>The Scripts</h3>
   
   <p>
      The Perl script used to build the documentation is build_docs.pl.
   </p>

   <p>
      The script goes through each file listed in map.txt, cleans it up
      and then adds logos, navigation bars, next/previous links,
      copyright information etc. The resulting files are put in the top-level
      documentation directory. 
   </p>

   <p>
      The "cleaning" strips the source HTML files down to the basics, removing
      everything from the header and removing Javascript, fonts, color, etc. It
      requires the HTML::TagFilter module which in turn also requires the
      HTML::Parser and HTML::Tagset modules (all available from <a href="http://search.cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a>).
   </p>

   <p>
      <i><a name="comment">NOTE</a>: Anything within a source file before the
      <code>&lt;!-- Begin utPLSQL Body --&gt;</code> comment line and after the 
      <code>&lt;!-- End utPLSQL Body --&gt;</code> comment line is ignored.</i>
