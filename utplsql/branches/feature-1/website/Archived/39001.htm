<p><title>Draft Spec for new utConfig Package Chris Rimmer chrisrimmer chris.rimmer@tessella.co.uk</title>
As far as utPLSQL.test is concerned, how would you expect to determine if the configuration had been set (manually)?<br>
<br>
Isn't your suggestion a bit counter-intuitive? Consider:<br>
<br>
1)Initially, X tests Y's code. X's own config gets used.<br>
2)X sets his default config to Z's.  Now when X tests Y's code, Y's config gets used.<br>
3)X sets his default config back to his own. Y's config is still used.<br>
<br>
Or did I misunderstand?<br>
<br>
