<p><title>Getting utPLSQL to work under Unix Steven Feuerstein sfeuerstein steven@stevenfeuerstein.com</title>
Thanks for identifying a few of those install glitches. I am fixing those now and will shortly publish a new version with a cleaner install process. <br>
<br>
In terms of your error: I need to improve error handling where UTL_FILE is concerned, but this statement:<br>
<br>
exec utplsql.setdir('/web/richard/packages/acs-kernel/sql/');<br>
<br>
is likely to cause problems. Try removing the trailing /, as in:<br>
<br>
exec utplsql.setdir('/web/richard/packages/acs-kernel/sql');<br>
<br>
Now in terms of your code, I believe that my doc still includes some references to the # as a delimiter, as in ut#xxxx. That is bad, bad, bad. Based on some early feedback,  (such as: the use of # causes problems on Unix systems), I switched to using _, as in ut_mypackage.<br>
<br>
So unless you override the default with the use of ut#, it will not find your test code.<br>
<br>
I am also in the process of converting all doc to HTML and cleaning it up. Thanks for your patience!<br>
<br>
Please let us know if this fixes your problem.<br>
