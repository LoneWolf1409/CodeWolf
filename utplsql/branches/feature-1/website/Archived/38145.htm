<p><title>utPLSQL v1.5.1 Pre-release software Steven Feuerstein sfeuerstein steven@stevenfeuerstein.com</title>
There are lots of improvements and I hope you have a moment to check it out. Major changes: <br>
<br>
*** Documentation is now available in HTML format (I am still finishing up the Examples.htm).<br>
 <br>
*** You can run utPLSQL on Oracle73, Oracle8 and Oracle8i! Yes, that's right. I finally took the time to make the product usable in multiple versions of Oracle. <br>
<br>
*** Improved usability: you no longer have to register your tests manually; your last usages (directory, prefix, etc.) are stored in the ut_config table and re-used; better display of results; improved error handling. <br>
<br>
*** Assertions to check for equality of collections. <br>
<br>
Here is what I need from you:<br>
<br>
1. If you are running on 7.3 or 8.0, please install utPLSQL and run it through some paces. I only have an 8i database available to me at the moment. So I have modified utPLSQL to THEORETICALLY run on 7.3 and 8.0, but I have not tested it yet on these versions. Please confirm with me that you have an earlier version of Oracle and will run some tests. <br>
<br>
2. Check out the documentation. I believe it is LIGHT YEARS better than the last set, but it is not complete and I need some other eyes to let me know where it needs to be strengthened, corrected, etc.<br>
<br>
3. A GUI, I need a GUI! Anyone out there following up on their volunteering to build a VB or Oracle Forms front end? This would be very useful. To me, the best thing would be something VERY minimal: select the program you want to test, run the test and show a big GREEN light or RED light. Please let me know if there is any progress in this area.<br>
<br>
Thanks, SF
