<p><title>Requirments Larry Church lchurch lchurch@corp.cma.com</title>
Will the following configuration work and allow my developers to perform unit testing from their NT workstations?<br>
<br>
1. Developers create oracle forms, reports, graphs, documents, templates on their NT 4.0 workstations. There are also developers using Visual Interdev and Visual Basic.<br>
<br>
2. The utPLSQL code/programs will reside on an NT Server which can be accessed by all developers.<br>
<br>
3. The Oracle databases required for utPLSQL will reside on a separate UNIX machine connected to the NT Server.<br>
<br>
So I've introduced Oracle on NT and UNIX.  We also have VB developers.<br>
<br>
The way I think it will work is:<br>
<br>
a. Developer creates/fixes code on personal NT Workstation.<br>
<br>
b. They log in to NT Server and save/ftp the changed code AND test data from NT Workstation to NT Server.<br>
<br>
c. Logged in to the NT Server, developer opens SQLPLUS 8.0 in Oracle of Windows NT against the ut database on the UNIX box.<br>
<br>
d. Developer creates/builds required test cases, setup and cleanup procedures in the ut_package_name.<br>
<br>
e. From SQLPLUS developer runs ut_package_name and results are stored in the Oracle database on UNIX.<br>
<br>
Do you see any problems with this plan?<br>
Any show stoppers that prohibit me from using utPLSQL the way I've described it?<br>
<br>
Thanks...Larry Church lchurch@corp.cma.com.<br>
