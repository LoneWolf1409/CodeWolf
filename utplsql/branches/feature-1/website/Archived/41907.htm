<p><title>Another perspective on auto-compile Jason Dufair jkdufair jase@deadbeets.com</title>
I'm interested in rolling out utPLSQL to my team for automating a lot of the tests we should have written years ago.  Here's my problem - I'd like to use the auto-recompile option, but it requires that all of the source is on the same box as Oracle.  All of our source is on an NT server (that is our version control server) separate from the Unix box that Oracle (7.3.4) is on.  We don't really have the option of setting up NFS or Samba to make these machines talk to each other, either.<br>
<br>
So what are my options?  I was going to try to tinker with compile in utplsql.pkb, but I can't think of any way that the package could access my i: drive.  I suppose I could write a SQL*Plus script to compile stuff (using @file.pkb...) and then call utPLSQL, but I'm hoping for something more elegant.  Any ideas?<br>
<br>
Does everyone else keep their source on the same box as their database server?<br>
