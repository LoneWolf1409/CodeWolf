Why WOULDN'T PL/SQL be a fine platform for testing PL/SQL?<br>
<br>
Sure you could build it with Java or VB or whatever -- are you thinking in terms of a GUI? <br>
<br>
But I like using PL/SQL because:<br>
<br>
1. It's the only tool I know (and not necessarily a crude tool as implied by "hammer", but hey, I am not offended. No way. ).<br>
<br>
2. PL/SQL developers can look at the code, understand it, change it to fit their needs, etc.<br>
<br>
Now ANY front end tool can be used to develop a GUI for utPLSQL!<br>
