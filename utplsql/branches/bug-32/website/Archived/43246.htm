I feel mixed about this. One of the principles underlying the utPLSQL (and Junit and XP unit testing) framework is that tests should be independent of one another. A failure in one test should NOT result in failures in all the others. Otherwise, as you indicate, you get lots of false negatives, which can be baffling and also demoralizing. <br>
<br>
I have, however, added your suggestion to the list of enhancement requests. It is certainly not a BIG deal to do, mostly quite tedious, given the number of assertion routines.
